# Hyprland Dot Files

This is still a work in progress.. Try it on your own risk.

#### The system:
- OS: EndeavourOS
- WM: Hyprland

#### The apps that I use:
- Alacritty as terminal
- Kitty as terminal alternative
- Neovim - I set it up with Youtube tutorials
- VSCode
- Obsidian
- Waybar
- Nemo for file manager
- Discord is used with BetterDiscord for theme and plug-in support
- Stylus plug-in for Firefox for custom .css themes for web sites. 

#### Things to do:
- [ ] Understand how to export Firefox settings.
- [ ] Write the neccessary dependencies - I am a Linux noob, don't know if I will write a correct one.
- [ ] Clean the dotfiles to make them more organized
- [ ] Learn to export the oh my bash settings as well

#### ~/.g-scripts Folder:
It includes some of the bash scripts that I wrote and use. But as you can tell from the scripts, I am a beginner, so I am still learning and they most probably are not efficient. But well.. I am learning and having fun. :)

#### Some screenshots:

If you use these dot-files, I hope that you enjoy using it as much as I do! :)
