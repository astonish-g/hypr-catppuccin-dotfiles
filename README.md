# Hyprland Dot Files

This is still a work in progress.. Try it on your own risk.

#### The system:
- **OS:** EndeavourOS
- **WM:** Hyprland

#### The apps that I use:
- **Alacritty** as terminal.
- **Kitty** as terminal alternative.
- **Neovim** - I set it up with Youtube tutorials.
- **VSCode** - can be seen in the screenshots.
- **Obsidian** - can be seen in the screenshots.
- **Waybar** for top bar.
- **Wofi** for app-launcher.
- **Nemo** for file manager.
- **Discord** is used with BetterDiscord for theme and plug-in support.
- **Stylus plug-in** for Firefox for custom .css themes for web sites.
- **Swayidle** to dim the screen and turn off the screen.
- **Swww** to cycle between the wallpapers every 10 minutes.
- **Grim** and **slurp** for screenshot.

#### Things to do:
- [ ] Understand how to export Firefox settings.
- [ ] Write the neccessary dependencies - I am a Linux noob, don't know if I will write a correct one.
- [ ] Clean the dotfiles to make them more organized
- [ ] Learn to export the oh my bash settings as well

#### ~/.g-scripts Folder:
It includes some of the bash scripts that I wrote and use. But as you can tell from the scripts, I am a beginner, so I am still learning and they most probably are not efficient. But well.. I am learning and having fun. :)
